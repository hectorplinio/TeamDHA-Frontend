# Css Frameworks

## Bootstrap

Developed by Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto at Twitter as a framework to promote consistency across internal tools, Bootstrap is an open-source framework containing CSS and JavaScript-based templates for interface components.

Bootstrap is known for popularizing the focus on responsive design among web developers. It promoted the now-ubiquitous concept of mobile-first and provided the right tools for its easy implementation. It did so by introducing a grid ‚Äì partitioning the screen into columns (invisible to the end user‚Äôs eye).

With Bootstrap, developers don‚Äôt have to build separate projects around adjusting a site for smaller screen sizes. They just need to incorporate the necessary Bootstrap classes, and the design adjusts itself.

### Why Choose Bootstrap?

-   <b>Massive Ecosystem:</b> Among front-end frameworks, Bootstrap‚Äôs ecosystem is unmatched. It offers, out of the box, a vast library of layouts, themes, UI elements, panels, modals, buttons, alerts, cards, etc., that devs and designers can choose from and implement. Additionally, Bootstrap is backed by best-in-industry community support.

-   <b>Accelerated prototyping:</b> When using Bootstrap, designers can just write out their HTML code, include the relevant CSS classes, and achieve website responsiveness. They don‚Äôt have to spend time adjusting for browser incompatibility, CSS positioning, and the like.

-   <b>Twitter Support:</b> Unsurprisingly, when a significant commercial player backs an open-source project, users can be assured that it is here to stay and carries high confidence among people who know the industry. The fact that Bootstrap grew out of, and is backed by Twitter, establishes its efficacy.

-   <b>Supports SASS and LESS:</b> Although most developers don‚Äôt use LESS, significant projects rely on it. Obviously, SASS support is also highly desirable. Not too many CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap support both.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS‚Äôs official documentation describes it as a ‚Äúutility-first CSS framework‚Äù that comes with classes equipped to build custom UI designs directly in the users‚Äô markup. It is handy to implement inline styling to rustle up a stunning UI without writing any CSS.

One of the most popular utility CSS libraries in existence, Tailwind CSS offers significant benefits for web design. Interestingly, it took Adam Wathan (the creator of Tailwind) to convince the world why utility-based CSS trumps semantic CSS. But eventually, enough developers believed him enough to start using Tailwind, and now it is used frequently enough to be on lists like this.

### Why Choose Tailwind CSS?

-   <b>Highly Customizable:</b> Tailwind CSS comes with a default configuration, but it can be overridden with a tailwind.config.js file. This enables easy customization of styling, themes, spacing, palettes, etc. Use Tailwind‚Äôs utilities to enable easy project management and develop a website that delights customers.

-   <b>Carries Commonly used Utility Pattern:</b> With Tailwind CSS, users can cut down on having to name too many classes. It comes with common utility patterns to deal with standard requirements: specifying and organizing classes, cascading classes, etc. In simple terms, creating custom components become so much easier. Instead of hard-coding, just use the theme() function to derive values from configuration files.

-   <b>PurgeCSS Optimization:</b> PurgeCSS reduces file size by scanning HTML code and eliminating unused classes. In combination with Tailwind CSS, this is particularly useful. As a project expands, so does the size of accompanying CSS files. Optimizing via PurgeCSS reduces and cleans up CSS file size, making it infinitely more manageable, especially before deployment.

-   <b>Responsiveness Made Easy:</b> By default, Tailwind CSS utilizes a mobile-first approach. To quote the website, ‚ÄúEvery utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.‚ÄùUtility classes simplify the creation of complex responsive layouts but allowing them to be used across multiple breakpoints. The result? Hassle-free implementation of responsive design.

-   <b>Effortless Community Interaction:</b> Tailwind‚Äôs active community is an excellent place for users to get their questions answered, especially when dealing with stubborn issues. Get CSS-related queries solved and create excellent websites faster.

## Foundation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73659203/170286708-59910e8c-1bf3-438f-8e0b-dc33cf20eb81.png)

Foundation calls itself ‚ÄúThe most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.‚Äù This responsive front-end framework provides a grid, HTML, SASS, and CSS UI elements, templates, and code that covers navigation, buttons, typography, forms, etc. It also comprises optional functionalities offered by JavaScript extensions.

Formerly managed by ZURB, Foundation is an open-source project that volunteers have run since 2019. It also operates with a mobile-first approach and is particularly useful for building large web apps requiring a design host.

### Why Choose Foundation?

-   <b>Massive toolkit:</b> Foundation offers more than what is required of a CSS framework. Its extensive, modular collection of tools helps solve issues for most front-end developers. For example, it offers separate framework elements for websites and emails; each prepped for functioning in those domains. It also provides a command-line interface (CLI), handy for devs working with module bundlers like Webpack.

-   <b>Greater Flexibility:</b> Foundation is built to offer front-end devs complete control over their UIs. For example, it doesn‚Äôt force devs to use a particular style or language. All of this makes it a preferred tool for a much wider range of developers.

-   <b>UI components and beyond:</b> Along with offering the standard UI components, Foundation also comes with a responsive image system, a pricing table, responsive embeds, form validation, right to left support, and much more. This gives web developers a lot more to play with.

-   <b>Training Options:</b> ZURB offers multiple training courses and consulting options for Foundation, which is especially helpful for companies that want to work on big projects and pay for it.

## Bulma

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73659203/170286824-d72064b8-1056-4685-a62d-8c36367046eb.png)

Bulma is an open-source, responsive CSS framework based on Flexbox. It comes with an impressive range of built-in features that facilitate faster turnaround and minimal CSS coding by hand. It implements tiles to create Metro-style grids, resulting in smooth page layouts. Additionally, users can import only the elements they will use, simplifying the process even further.

Given that Bulma‚Äôs source code is free for download, users can extend its functionality as they see fit. It provides a no-nonsense, CSS-only methodology (no JavaScript components) and visually appealing defaults to get started with.

Bulma has been highly adopted within the Laravel community, which has helped with its increasing popularity.

### Why Choose Bulma?

-   <b>Easy to use:</b> Bulma‚Äôs modular design approach and highly customizable nature make it a preferred tool among devs and designers. Its responsive templates cut down on design effort, and it has a rich catalog of components to choose from ‚Äì nav bars, tables, panels, dropdown menus, etc. Bulma also comes with starter templates and interactive tutorials. It also has a robust Stack Overflow community that is greatly helpful for having questions answered.

-   <b>Easy to learn:</b> Bulma‚Äôs modular nature is meant to solve practical problems that individual developers may encounter. Bulma is designed to be easily navigable, and individuals can quickly figure out how it works.

-   <b>Browser-Agnostic:</b> Bulma-designed websites are compatible with most major browsers. This makes life easier for testers, especially when conducting cross browser testing.

-   <b>Robust Update Schedule:</b> Bulma might be new on the scene, but new features are added almost constantly. Additionally, updates are implemented to address existing bugs or issues users may be dealing with.

## Conclusion
